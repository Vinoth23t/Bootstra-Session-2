 <p style="text-center"class="bg-light mx-5">Technology companies this year have been hit with global economic turbulence that is slowing growth and spurring widespread layoffs, even as enterprise IT spending in some areas—such as cloud computing—seems to be holding steady.

    According to TrueUp’s tech layoff tracker, there were 1,405 rounds of layoffs at tech companies globally through the first week of December, affecting 219,959 people.
    When global economic headwinds started picking up earlier in the year, many technology companies reacted to fears of an incoming recession by putting the brakes on hiring. The bad news is—amid rising interest rates, the ongoing war in Ukraine, high fuel costs, supply chain issues, and a decline in personal PC sales—most of those freezes have since been accompanied by job cuts, as companies look for ways to reduce operating costs.    
    While enterprise IT spending is still forecast to grow over the next year as companies use tech to battle expected recession, bright spots offered by enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure and SaaS applications hasn't been enough to completely lighten the overall picture for tech industry giants.
    Exchange rates and the PC sales slump worked to slow Microsoft's net income growth to its lowest level in five years for the September quarter. At Alphabet,  September quarter revenue slowed to 6% despite a big jump in cloud sales.    
    The general macroecononic environment also shows some signs of affecting cloud infrastructure spending. AWS' September quarter revenue was up 27.5% year on year, but slower than the 33% rise for the prior quarter and 36.5% growth the quarter before that.
    With the economic outlook for 2023 unlikely to fill business leaders with much optimism, it’s likely the number of job losses recorded by TrueUp will continue to grow.
    Here is a list—to be updated regularly—of some of the most prominent technology layoffs the industry has experienced recently.
